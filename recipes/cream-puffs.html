        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cream puffs might seem fancy, but they're actually quite simple to make in the comfort of your own kitchen! Create a decadent, impressive, bakery-worthy dessert at home with this top-rated cream puff recipe.</p>            
        <p>Cream puffs, or profiteroles, are French choux pastry balls filled with cream. Choux pastry is made without leavening agents â€” instead, it relies on a high moisture content to create steam and puff the pastry during baking.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Instant Pudding Mix</li>
            <li>Cream and Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the instant pudding mix, heavy cream, and milk in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until the filling is set.</li>
            <li>Bring butter and water to a boil, then add the flour and salt. Stir until the mixture forms a ball. Transfer the ball to a mixing bowl, then beat in eggs one at a time. Drop spoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated oven until they're golden brown on the outside and dry on the inside.</li>
            <li>Let the choux pastry cool. Fill the cream puffs in one of two ways: Split the pastries and fill or pipe the pudding mixture into the shells.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the cream puffs as-is, dust them with powdered sugar, or drizzle them with melted chocolate. For a stunning presentation, stack the cream puffs in a cone-like shape to create a show-stopping croquembouche.</li>
